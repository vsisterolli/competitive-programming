Sum of Divisors of N

Let N = P^k * Q'^z where p and q are primes

Sum of Divisors = P^(k + 1)/(P - 1) * Q^(z + 1)/(Q - 1);


Multionmial (n | k1, k2, k3, ..., kn)
Ways of dividing N into sets of size k1, k2, k3, ..., kn such that k1 + k2 + ... + kn = N
= n1!/(k1! * k2! * k3! * k4!!)

Dearrangements
Number of permutations where no element keeps its original position
-> Use inclusion-exclusion prinicipial or

f(n) = {
    0, n = 1
    1, n = 2
    (n - 1)(f(n - 2) + f(n - 1)), n > 2
}


Burnside lemma:
The number of objects equals the average of simmetrycal pictures for every simmetries

The problem example is coloring a 3x3 table, and if a table is equal to the other one by rotating it, they are the same
There are 5^9 simmetries for rotating 0 degrees, 5^3 90 degrees, 5^5 180 degrees and 5^3 270 degrees so the total number of pictures is
(5^9 + 5^3 + 5^5 + 5^3)/4, just see how many squares are free and how many are determined by simmetry
