# competitive-programming

This is where i save my own codes for competitive programming, including libraries, solves for exercises, etc.
Remind that speed-coding really matters into competitive programming, so the code will not be well-writen since i'm the only one who will ever use these codes and they are made thinking on how fast I can use them.

Competitive programming is where we use our logic and knowledge in algorithms and data-structures to try to solve computational problems, we wave well-known competitions such as IOI and ACM-ICPC.
